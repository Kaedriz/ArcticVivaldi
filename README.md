✌️ Vivaldi theme, which presents you with clean UI. Used mostly with Tabs on the sides, other not supported currently. Capability to theme various thing in browser which vanilla themes doesn't support. Developed and used mostly in Linux, so no window control, but support of it is planned.

## Naming
